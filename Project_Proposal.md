# Emotion-Recognition
## Introduction
Humans are capable of conveying many emotions through their faces. From happy to sad or even angry. Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. People vary widely in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Technology can be used to recognize these emotions.

## Problem statement
Can a deep learning classification model be able to differentiate between emotions from images of faces?

## Data Description
The dataset contain more than 35,000 examples of 48x48 pixel greyscale images of faces. Images are categorized based on the emotion shown in the facial expressions (happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear). The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer).
